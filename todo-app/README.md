# Todo List App

A simple, responsive Todo List application built using JavaScript and JSX. This app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, helping them organize their daily activities efficiently. The interface is designed for smooth interaction, with features like task editing, task wrapping, and responsive button placement.
